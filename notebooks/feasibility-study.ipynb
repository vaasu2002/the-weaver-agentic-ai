    "\n",
    "### Technical Feasibility Assessment\n",
    "Evaluate the project's technical viability considering:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technology Stack Analysis:**\n",
    "- Assess compatibility and maturity of the proposed technology stack\n",
    "- Evaluate team expertise requirements and learning curve\n",
    "- Identify technical dependencies and third-party integrations\n",
    "- Review scalability and performance requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resource Evaluation:**\n",
    "- Analyze required development team size and skill sets\n",
    "- Assess infrastructure and hosting requirements\n",
    "- Evaluate development tools and environment needs\n",
    "- Identify knowledge gaps and training requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk Assessment:**\n",
    "- Identify major technical challenges and obstacles\n",

    "\n",
    "### Economic Feasibility Assessment\n",
    "Analyze the project's financial viability:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost Analysis:**\n",
    "- Calculate development costs (team salaries, tools, infrastructure)\n",
    "- Estimate operational costs (hosting, maintenance, support)\n",

    "## Analysis Guidelines:\n",
    "1. Base assessments on realistic assumptions and industry standards\n",
    "2. Consider technology-specific development challenges and benefits\n",
    "3. Factor in timeline constraints and resource availability\n",
    "4. Prioritize critical and high-priority requirements in analysis\n",
    "5. Provide actionable insights for decision-making\n",
    "6. Use concrete numbers and specific examples where possible\n",
    "7. Address both optimistic and conservative scenarios\n",
    "8. Maintain objectivity and professional judgment\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate a comprehensive feasibility study that addresses all technical and economic aspects. The analysis should be detailed, realistic, and provide clear recommendations for project approval or rejection based on the feasibility assessment.\n",
